AR Labyrinth is a modern take on the classic game Labyrinth. Users can draw their own maze and then scan it into the game. To provide a tactile input similar to the original game, the player can hold the physical map under a webcam and tilt it to control the virtual ball. AR Labyrinth uses OpenCV's feature detection to compute homographies that track the tilt of the map in the webcam stream, and Panda3D as a 3D physics engine to generate user created maps and run the game.

AR-Labyrinth was created by Jacky Lee, Cole Kurashige, and Owen Gillespie
